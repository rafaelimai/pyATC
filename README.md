The idea of this repository is to center the files and data regarding tests that I am doing, as a hobbyist, relating ATC (yeah, Air Traffic Control) and Python. 

I will attempt to find interesting stuff by using ML-related stuff. Let the sky be the limit, my free time the constraint, and as I am an engineer, pi = 3.14.
